PSGI is awesome. Very awesome!

Now that we have a lot of PSGI servers, it's difficult to know which to pick
for each task. Each one supports a different combination of PSGI features.

This is a (growing) list of PSGI servers, and the PSGI features they implement.

The list is compiled first by hardcoded data, but later will be done
dynamically by introspecting the server, and later by having actual tests for
these features, hopefully. :)

Hope it's useful for you.

P.S.
I hope to get this hosted at a proper URL at some point.
